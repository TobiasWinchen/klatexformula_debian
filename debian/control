Package: klatexformula
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: GUI to easily get an image from a LaTeX formula or equation
 With klatexformula, just enter a formula and click "Evaluate" to get an image
 of a LaTeX formula. You can drag&drop, copy or save the resulting image
 directly from the GUI, which makes klatexformula a very convenient tool for
 presentations. Klatexformula also provides also tools for equation prototyping
 in LaTeX and a user-library of used equations.

Package: libklatexformula3
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Runtime libraries for klatexformula 
 With Klatexformula, just enter a formula and click "Evaluate" to get an image
 of a LaTeX formula. You can drag&drop, copy or save the resulting image
 directly from the GUI, which makes klatexformula a very convenient tool for
 presentations. Klatexformula also provides also tools for equation prototyping
 in LaTeX and a user-library of used equations.
 This package provides the libraries klatexformula is based on.

Package: libklatexformula3-dev
Architecture: any
Section: libdevel
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends} 
Description: Runtime libraries for klatexformula, development files 
 With Klatexformula, just enter a formula and click "Evaluate" to get an image
 of a LaTeX formula. You can drag&drop, copy or save the resulting image
 directly from the GUI, which makes klatexformula a very convenient tool for
 presentations. Klatexformula also provides also tools for equation prototyping
 in LaTeX and a user-library of used equations.
 This package contains the header files and static libraries to build the
 klatexformula libraries.
