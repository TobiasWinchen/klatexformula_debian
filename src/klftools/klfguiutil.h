/** \brief A Progress Dialog
 *
 * This class is a QProgressDialog derivative that is optimized to work for klatexformula's needs,
 * especially making it easy to use with KLFProgressReporter.
 *
 * Among others, this dialog provides a straightforward option to disable the Cancel button.
 *
 * Basically this is just a wrapper around QProgressDialog's functions. Typical use is:
 * \code
 *  MyWidget::someLengthyOperation()
 *  {
 *    int number_of_steps = ...;
 *    KLFProgressDialog pdlg(false, this); // disable cancel
 *    KLFProgressReporter progressReporter(0, number_of_steps);
 *    pdlg.startReportingProgress(&progressReporter, "Please wait until some long operation completes...");
 *    ...
 *    int step = 0;
 *    for (step = 0; step < number_of_steps; ++step) {
 *      // an iteration step
 *      ...
 *      progressReporter.doReportProgress(step)
 *    }
 *  }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The previous example is somewhat trivial and does not exhibit the advantages of the features of
 * this class and of KLFProgressReporter over QProgressDialog; the example of KLFLibResourceEngine
 * is more relevant:
 * \code
 * // klflib.h  : the library resource engine system (no GUI)
 * class KLFLibResourceEngine {
 *    ....
 * signals:
 *   void operationStartReportingProgress(KLFProgressReporter *progressReporter, const QString& label);
 *
 *   ...
 * };
 *
 * // klflibbrowser.cpp  : the library browser (GUI)
 *   ...
 * bool KLFLibBrowser::openResource(...)
 * {
 *   ...
 *   connect(resource, SIGNAL(operationStartReportingProgress(KLFProgressReporter *, const QString&)),
 *	  this, SLOT(slotStartProgress(KLFProgressReporter *, const QString&)));
 *   ...
 * }
 * void KLFLibBrowser::slotStartProgress(KLFProgressReporter *progressReporter, const QString& label)
 * {
 *   KLFProgressDialog *pdialog = new KLFProgressDialog(false, QString(), this);
 *   pdialog->startReportingProgress(progressReporter, label);
 *   ...
 * }
 * \endcode
 * which opens a progress dialog whenever the resource emits an <tt>operationStartReportingProgress()</tt>
 * signal. Note that in this example, we have not provided the means to delete the progress dialog once
 * it has completed; for details have a look at the source code of klflibbrowser.cpp.
 *
 * For yet another example of inline (on-the-stack) usage of KLFProgressDialog, check out
 * KLFLibBrowser::slotExport() in klflibbrowser.cpp.
 *
 * \todo .... I'm not sure, but to delete the dialog, couldn't we simply connect
 *   KLFProgressReporter::finished() to KLFProgressDialog::deleteLater() ... ? needs a test.
