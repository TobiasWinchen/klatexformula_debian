 *   values of the property to compare for each entry, and compares the strings with
 *   \ref QString::localeAwareCompare().
 * - \ref entryValue() provides sensible string representations for the given property in the

 *   In other words, if isValid() is false (or equivalently, if \ref propId() is negative), don't
 *   attempt any sorting or comparisions.
 *
 * To customize the behaviour of this class, you may subclass it and reimplement any level
 * of its behavior, eg. you may want to just reimplement entryValue() to alter the string
 * representation of the values of some properties, or you could reimplement compareLessThan()
 * to do more sophisticated comparisions.
 *
 * \note There is no copy constructor. If there was, there would be no way of customizing the sort

/** \brief An abstract resource engine
 *
 * This class is the base of all resource types. Subclasses (e.g. KLFLibDBEngine) implement
 * the actual access to the data, while this class defines the base API that will be used
 * by e.g. the library browser (through a KLFAbstractLibView subclass) to access the data.
 *
 * Subclasses may choose to implement various features specified by the \ref ResourceFeature
 * enum. The supported features must be passed (binary OR-ed) to the constructor.
 *
 * Library resources provide entries without any particular order.
 *
 * Library entries are communicated with KLFLibEntry objects. Each entry in the resource must
 * be attributed a numerical ID, which is unique within the resource, in particular not
 * necessarily globally unique among all open resources. For engines implementing the
 * \ref FeatureSubResources feature, the attributed IDs have only to be unique within the
 * sub-resource the entry lives in.
 *
 * Entries are queried by calling for example the functions: \ref allEntries(), \ref entries(),
 * \ref entry(). See the individual function documentation for more details.
 *
 * The API in this class for accessing data is pretty elaborate. You may consider to subclass
 * \ref KLFLibResourceSimpleEngine, which requires you to implement a simpler API, but at the
 * price of not being able to take profit of the optimization opportunities given by the
 * more complicated API.
 *
 * <b>Resource Properties</b>. Resources have properties (stored in a
 * KLFPropertizedObject structure, NOT in regular QObject
 * properties) that ARE STORED IN THE RESOURCE DATA ITSELF. Built-in properties are listed
 * in the \ref ResourceProperty enum. Some properties may be implemented read-only
 * (eg. \ref PropAccessShared) in which case saveResourceProperty() should return FALSE.
 *
 * The view used to display this resource is stored in the "ViewType" resource property (and
 * thus should be stored in the backend data like other properties).
 *
 * <b>Note on URL</b>. The URL is not a resource property as it is not stored in the resource
 * itself. However the resource engine instance knows about the url it is manipulating
 * (because subclasses pass the relevant url as parameter in the constructor). However, the
 * URL itself blindly stored and reprovided when requested; it is not used by
 * KLFLibResourceEngine itself. Small exception: in the constructor, some query items are
 * recognized and stripped from the URL. See below.
 *
 * <b>Read-Only Mode</b>. The read-only mode differs from the locked property in that the
 * mode is activated by the accessor only and is NOT stored in the resource data eg. on disk
 * (in contrast to the locked property). It is up to SUBCLASSES to enforce this flag and
 * prevent data from being modified if isReadOnly() is TRUE.<br>
 * Subclasses may prevent read-only mode by not specifying
 * the FeatureReadOnly in the constructor. In this case the default implementation of
 * \ref setReadOnly() will return FALSE without doing anything. Also in this case, any
 * occurrence of the query item "klfReadOnly" in the URL is stripped and ignored.
 *
 * <b>Sub-Resources</b>. Sub-resources are a way of logically separating the contents of
 * a resource into separate so-called "sub-resources", like for example a library could
 * contain a sub-resource "History", "Archive" etc. Derived subclasses don't have to
 * implement subresources, they can specify if subresources are available using the
 * FeatureSubResources flag in the constructor. In classes implementing sub-resources,
 * the <i>default sub-resource</i> (queried by \ref defaultSubResource() and set by
 * \ref setDefaultSubResource()) is the resource that the \ref insertEntry(),
 * \ref changeEntries(), etc.
 * family functions will access when the variant of the function without sub-resource
 * argument is called.
 *
 * <b>Sub-Resource Properties</b>. Sub-resources, when implemented by the subclass, may
 * each have properties (the API would suggest subclasses to store these property values
 * into \ref KLFPropertizedObject's). The properties (structure+values) are NOT stored
 * by KLFLibResourceEngine itself, all the work must be done by the subclass, in particular
 * reimplementing \ref subResourceProperty() and \ref setSubResourceProperty(). Again this
 * feature is implemented by the subclass if and only if the subclass specified
 * \ref FeatureSubResourceProps in the constructor argument. In this case note also that views
 * may for example expect the resource to provide values for the sub-resource properties defined
 * by \ref SubResourceProperty.
 *
 * <b>query Items in URL</b>. The URL may contain query items e.g.
 * <tt>scheme://klf.server.dom/path/to/location<b>?klfReadOnly=true</b></tt>. Here is a
 * list of recognized (universal) query items. Subclasses may choose to recognize more query
 * items, but these listed here are detected in the KLFLibResourceEngine constructor and
 * the appropriate flags are set (eg. \ref isReadOnly()):
 * - <tt>klfReadOnly=</tt>{<tt>true</tt>|<tt>false</tt>} If provided, sets the read-only
 *   flag to the given value. If not provided, the flag defaults to false (flag is directly
 *   set, bypassing the setReadOnly() function).
 * - <tt>klfDefaultSubResource=<i>sub-resource name</i></tt> If provided, specifies which
 *   sub-resource (which has to be present in the given location) should be opened by default.
 *   See \ref setDefaultSubResource().
 * .
 * Note that recognized query items (and <i>only</i> the query items recognized at the
 * KLFLibResourceEngine level) are stripped from the \ref url() as they are parsed. Subclasses
 * may choose to (independently) recognize and strip other query items from URL if it is relevant
 * to do so.
 *
 * <b>NOTES FOR SUBCLASSES</b><br>
 * - Subclasses must deal with the properties and implement them as they are meant to, and
 *   as they have been documented in their respective functions (see \ref locked(), \ref title()).
 *   For example, if a resource is \ref locked(), then \ref canModifyData() and \ref canModifyProp()
 *   must return FALSE and any attempt to modify the resource must fail.
 * - Subclasses must reimplement \ref saveResourceProperty() to save the new property value
 *   to the backend data, or return FALSE to cancel the resource change. Calls to
 *   \ref setLocked(), \ref setTitle() or setViewType() all call in turn \ref setResourceProperty(),
 *   the default implementation of which is usually sufficient, which calls in turn
 *   \ref saveResourceProperty().
 * - See also docs for \ref setResourceProperty() and \ref saveResourceProperty().
 * - The \ref resourcePropertyChanged() is emitted in the default implementation of
 *   \ref setResourceProperty().
 * - lengthy operations should emit the signal \ref operationStartReportingProgress() with a suitable
 *   KLFProgressReporter as necessary to inform callers of progress of operations that can take some
 *   time. This is recommended, but subclasses aren't forced to comply (for laziness' sake for ex...).
 *   However, subclasses should test ONCE per operation whether \ref thisOperationProgressBlocked() and
 *   should not emit progress in that case.
